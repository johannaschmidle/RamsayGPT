1. **Variation of TOPIC**, where RamsayGPT will give you different variations of the topic which will help you study the differences between them
2. **Game to learn TOPIC**, where RamsayGPT will create a game to help you learn the topic
3. **Explain TOPIC**, where RamsayGPT will give an explanation of the topic
   
Feel free to choose the option that best fits your learning style! But be careful, RamsayGPT gets impatient if you don't answer the prompts correctly :(
